+Terms of Service<br><br>

1. Parties<br>
This agreement is between you ("You" or "Your" in this agreement) and Underscore App ("Underscore”).<br><br>

2. Service Offered<br>
Underscore is a social news reader. Using our Service, you can discover news stories shared by the internet. We really don't care how you use our Service or what you use it for as long as it's legal, safe, and doesn't breach this Agreement.<br><br> 

3. What we'll know about you<br>
Underscore does not intentionally store any personal information. This is subject to change.<br><br> 

4. Disclaimer (Don't say we didn't warn you)<br>
We don't make the news – we don't even publish it. In fact, we're so lazy that we just kind of sit back while other people share news stories on the internet. Because of this, we can hardly be expected to be responsible for the reliability of the news linked to from our Site. As such, you release us from any liability for injury, financial loss, spitting out your coffee in anger while shaking your fist at your computer screen, or any other harm which may arise from reading the news on our Site.<br><br>

5. Third Party Libraries<br>
The Underscore App contains libraries developed by third parties. Underscore may provide third party libraries to You as part of the Underscore App solution but shall not be considered to be the owner or licensor of the third party libraries. Please refer to and respect the relevant third-party licenses.<br><br>

6. Copyright<br>
Although the news stories aggregated on our Site are actually posted on some other website, we may have original content on our Site. You therefore agree to not copy, distribute, display, disseminate, or otherwise reproduce any of the information on our website, or our website itself, without our prior written permission. This includes, but is not limited to, copying the arrangement of links that we have on our Site.<br><br>

We base much of our Service on user-contributed content. Because of this, we have to ensure that Users who use our Site know that they're letting us use their content, and that we can't just remove it whenever they want or else we'd go bankrupt paying for all of the people it takes to browse through pages and removes stuff. You therefore agree to grant us a universal, perpetual, irrevocable, commercial and non-commercial, sublicensable right to use any content which you contribute to us. You also warrant to us that you have the right to grant such a right to us when contributing content, and that you will indemnify us for any loss as a result of a breach of this warranty.<br><br>

7. Submitted Feedback & Ideas<br>
If You choose to provide feedback on the features or functions of the Underscore App (“Submitted Feedback”) then You shall be deemed to have given permission to Underscore to incorporate Your Submitted Feedback into the Underscore App. Underscore shall be free to make use of Your Submitted Feedback without royalty or obligation of any kind.<br><br>

8. DMCA Notices<br>
Once upon a time, Congressmen battled an evil army of ISPs and P2P file sharers. Eventually, the two sides compromised, and formed a peace treaty known as the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. This Act, commonly referred to as the "DMCA" by Internet folk, protects us from being sued for copyright infringement unless you first give us a chance to take down infringing content. If you believe that your copyright has been infringed, please stop complaining and instead send us a message which contains:<br><br>

Your name.<br>
The name of the party whose copyright has been infringed, if different from your name.<br>
The name and description of the work that is being infringed.<br>
The location on our website of the infringing copy.<br>
A statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted work described above is not authorised by the copyright owner (or by a third party who is legally entitled to do so on behalf of the copyright owner) and is not otherwise permitted by law.<br>
A statement that you swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information contained in this notification is accurate and that you are the copyright owner or have an exclusive right in law to bring infringement proceedings with respect to its use.<br>
You must sign this notification and send it to our Copyright Agent at:<br><br>

Attn: Underscore App Copyright Agent<br>
Underscore App<br>
90 Church Street<br>
New York, NY 10007<br>

If sending the notification by e-mail, an electronic signature is acceptable. If sending a physical letter, we'd be really impressed if you signed in your own blood or gold or something, but ink is fine, too.<br><br>

Additionally, although no similar procedure exists under American law for trademark infringement, we recommend following a similar procedure as that described above to notify us of alleged trademark infringement, so that we can take prompt action to correct the infringement.<br><br>

9. Representations & Warranties<br>

LISTEN UP BECAUSE WE'RE BEING TOTALLY SERIOUS RIGHT NOW – SO SERIOUS THAT WE HAVE TO YELL.<br><br>

WE MAKE NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES AS TO THE MERCHANTABILITY OF OUR OR OUR GOODS OR SERVICES OR FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE. YOU AGREE THAT YOU ARE RELEASING US FROM ANY LIABILITY THAT WE MAY OTHERWISE HAVE TO YOU IN RELATION TO OR ARISING FROM THIS AGREEMENT OR OUR PRODUCTS, FOR REASONS INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, FAILURE OF OUR SERVICE, NEGLIGENCE, REALLY BORING NEWS, OR ANY OTHER TORT. TO THE EXTENT THAT APPLICABLE LAW RESTRICTS THIS RELEASE OF LIABILITY, BECAUSE SOME POLITICIAN DECIDED YOU COULDN'T BE TRUSTED TO READ YOUR OWN CONTRACTS, YOU AGREE THAT WE ARE ONLY LIABLE TO YOU FOR THE MINIMUM AMOUNT OF DAMAGES THAT THE LAW RESTRICTS OUR LIABILITY TO, IF SUCH A MINIMUM EXISTS.<br><br>

WE ARE NOT LIABLE FOR ANY FAILURE OF THE GOODS OR SERVICES OF OUR COMPANY OR A THIRD PARTY, INCLUDING ANY FAILURES OR DISRUPTIONS, UNTIMELY DELIVERY, SCHEDULED OR UNSCHEDULED, INTENTIONAL OR UNINTENTIONAL, ON OUR SITE WHICH PREVENT ACCESS TO OUR SITE TEMPORARILY OR PERMANENTLY.<br><br>

THE PROVISION OF OUR SERVICE TO YOU IS CONTINGENT ON YOUR AGREEMENT WITH THIS AND ALL OTHER SECTIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT. NOTHING IN THE PROVISIONS OF THIS "REPRESENTATIONS & WARRANTIES" SECTION SHALL BE CONSTRUED TO LIMIT THE GENERALITY OF THE FIRST PARAGRAPH OF THIS SECTION.<br><br>

For Jurisdictions that do not allow us to limit our liability: Notwithstanding any provision of these Terms, if your jurisdiction has provisions specific to waiver or liability that conflict with the above then our liability is limited to the smallest extent possible by law. Specifically, in those jurisdictions not allowed, we do not disclaim liability for: (a) death or personal injury caused by its negligence or that of any of its officers, employees or agents; or (b) fraudulent misrepresentation; or (c) any liability which it is not lawful to exclude either now or in the future.<br><br>

IF YOU ARE A RESIDENT OF A JURISDICTION THAT REQUIRES A SPECIFIC STATEMENT REGARDING RELEASE THEN THE FOLLOWING APPLIES. <br><br>

10. Indemnity<br>
You agree to indemnify Underscore against any claims, damages, losses or legal fees incurred due to Your use (or misuse) of the Underscore App.<br><br>

11. Choice of Law<br>
This Agreement shall be governed by the laws in force in the State of New York. The offer and acceptance of this contract is deemed to have occurred in the State of New York.<br><br>

12. Forum of Dispute<br>
In order to limit the costs and complexity of legal proceedings against Underscore, you agree that any dispute naming Underscore or a party acting for or on behalf of Underscore arising from or relating to this Agreement will be heard solely by the New York small claims system ("Small Claims Court"). You agree that even if you may be entitled to a monetary, equitable, or other remedy exceeding the jurisdiction of the Small Claims Court, you will waive your right to that remedy and still bring your action within the Small Claims Court.<br><br>

If the subject matter of a dispute includes multiple claims, at least one of which is eligible to be heard in the Small Claims Court, you will release us from liability for the ineligible subject matter and will instead proceed with the eligible subject matter within the Small Claims Court.<br><br>

If, after the application of these Forum of Dispute provisions, your claim is still ineligible to be heard in the Small Claims Court, you agree that the dispute shall be heard in the next most summary manner available in a court of competent jurisdiction.<br><br>

If you bring a dispute in a manner other than in accordance with this section, you agree that we may move to have it dismissed, and that you will be responsible for our reasonable attorneys' fees, court costs, and disbursements in doing so.<br><br>

You agree that in a case brought within the Small Claims Court, the awarding of costs, attorneys' fees, and other expenses shall be governed by the rules of the Small Claims Court.<br><br>

You agree that in a case brought outside of the Small Claims Court, the prevailing party in any dispute will be entitled to claim from the unsuccessful party the entire amount of the prevailing party's reasonable attorneys' fees, costs, and disbursements in relation to the dispute.<br><br>

13. Force Majeure (Someone else's fault)<br>
You agree that we are not responsible to you for anything that we may otherwise be responsible for, if it is the result of events beyond our control, including, but not limited to, acts of God, war, insurrection, riots, terrorism, crime, labor shortages (including lawful and unlawful strikes), slow news days, embargoes, postal disruption, communication disruption, disappearance of the Interwebs, failure or shortage of infrastructure, shortage of materials, or any other event beyond our control.<br><br>

14. Severability<br>
Sometimes, a judge or a legislature may decide that even though you and Underscore entered into a voluntary agreement, they're gonna rain on our parade and tell us that we can't do something in our contract. In the event that a provision of this Agreement is found to be unlawful, conflicting with another provision of the Agreement, or otherwise unenforceable, the Agreement will remain in force as though it had been entered into without that unenforceable provision being included in it.<br><br>

If two or more provisions of this Agreement are deemed to conflict with each other's operation, Underscore shall have the sole right to elect which provision remains in force.<br><br>

15. Non-Waiver<br>
No action or inaction of Underscore shall be considered a waiver of any right or obligation by Underscore.<br><br>

16. Amendment<br>
This agreement may be amended by Underscore by providing You with 30 days notice of any proposed change. If You do not agree to the amended terms then Your sole remedy shall be to cease using the Underscore App.<br><br>

17. Termination & Cancellation<br>
We may terminate your account or our provision of services to you, without explanation, though we will strive to provide a timely explanation in most cases, unless we did it because you didn't play by the rules and breached our Rules of Conduct or something, in which case we might just block you and ignore you.<br><br>

18. Assignment<br>
You may not assign this agreement. Underscore may assign this agreement upon 15 days notice.<br><br>

19. Entire Agreement<br>
This is the entire agreement between the parties and supersedes any other agreement, representations (or misrepresentations), or understanding, however communicated.<br><br>

All Underscore App staff are bound by confidentiality agreements.<br><br>

20. Support Requests<br>
If you contact support then as part of the support request we may incidentally collect your personally identifying information but we will endeavor to keep that information secure and confidential. Support information may be managed using a third-party service and further terms of that service may apply to your support request.<br><br>

21. Privacy Questions<br>
Questions should be directed to: dev @ underscore . team<br><br>

Underscore App reserves the right to change or amend any part of its Privacy Policy at any time in the future.
